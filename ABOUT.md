# About

I would like to use the last minutes of this interview to talk about myself and my connection to C++.

I rehearsed this part, but please feel free to interrupt me for questions.

## Me and C++

I first learned about C++ when I was twelve, searching through now ancient blog posts for game development tutorials. At the time, I didn't really know English, so I just skimmed through the code, copy-pasting, and hitting the debug button on Visual Studio 2010; if something failed, I would just revert my changes and try again.

Back then, my intention was to make my own 2D fighting game, and despite not being able to reach that goal, I was able to make a stick character move forward and backward on the screen, which made me quite glad as a kid.

In 2017, with a much better understanding of English, my interest in the development of programming languages grew, as I wanted to create my own, and I knew that to do that I would need to know a lot more about computers and programming languages.

At this point, I discovered "Modern C++" and understood that I was not using the language to its fullest potential.

This made me change my approach to C++. I started watching conference talks, reading formal documents and archived mailing lists. I became interested in working in the foundations of the language and understood that was what I wanted.

Unfortunately, there is no market for C++ where I live currently and it's hard to find communities to talk about it. Despite following a lot of amazing folks that talk about C++ online, I've never had the courage to interact with them, as I feared my lack of experience working with C++ would be a demerit.

So I've been keen on this language for a long time, believing that if I kept honing my skills, I would be able to find a way to work on the foundations of C++ and game development.

## Portfolio

Due to HDD failures over the years, the last one being as recent as December 2021, I lost most of the code I wrote in the past.

I used to keep all my code offline even in the projects I used git. This was a big mistake of mine, and I regret it.

The code in this repository is an attempt to join the sparse code I've written this year.

## Goal

With all that said, my real goal if accepted for this job is to improve my skills even further.

It would be a pleasure to work under your guidance to become someone who not only uses C++ but also works to make it a better language.

I want to be able to engage in conferences, write papers, and join the amazing community of programmers that keep the language alive and breathing. 

Those are my aspirations.

Thank you for your time.

## Disclosure

I found out about this position through a post of yours on Twitter.

I looked at the given details and after I understood it accepted worldwide applications, I knew I had to give it a try.
